"""Shared, reusable httpx.AsyncClient with idle-timeout recycling.

Previously, four separate modules (ghsync, axiom_logs, bot, notify) each
duplicated the same ~20-line `_get_client()` pattern. This module centralizes
it into a single ReusableClient class with per-module tuning.

Benefits:
  - DRY: one implementation, four configs.
  - Memory: connection pools are closed on idle timeout, not held forever.
  - Testability: easy to mock.
